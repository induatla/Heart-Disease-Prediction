# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the world for the past 10 years. The diagnosis of this 
disease is difficult as it contains a lot of factors to consider and based on all those factors prediction has
to be performed precisely and efficiently. So by using Machine learning algorithms and techniques, we 
will get a good accuracy value in predicting compared to data mining techniques and other techniques.
Factors such as gender, age, chest pain, fasting sugar level, etc. are used in diagnosing the disease. Other 
indicators include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity, or drinking
too much alcohol. Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is 
very important in healthcare. Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine 
learning methods to detect "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's condition.
EXISTING SYSTEM: 
Clinical decisions are often made based on doctors’ instruction and experience rather than on the 
knowledge-rich data hidden in the database. This practice leads to unwanted biases, errors, and excessive 
medical costs which affects the quality of service provided to patients. There are many ways that a medical 
misdiagnosis can present itself. Whether a doctor is at fault, or hospital staff, a misdiagnosis of a serious 
illness can have very extreme and harmful effects. The National Patient Safety Foundation cites that 42% 
of medical patients feel they have experienced a medical error or missed diagnosis. Patient safety is 
sometimes negligently given the back seat for other concerns, such as the cost of medical tests, drugs, and 
operations. Medical Misdiagnoses are a serious risk to our healthcare profession. If they continue, then 
people will fear going to the hospital for treatment. We can put an end to medical misdiagnosis by 
informing the public and filing claims and suits against the medical practitioners at fault.
Disadvantages: 
• Prediction is not possible at the early stages.
• In the Existing System, practical use of collected data is time-consuming. 
• Any faults occurring by the doctor or hospital staff in predicting would lead to fatal incidents. 
• A highly expensive and laborious process needs to be performed before treating the patient to find 
out if he/she has any chance of getting heart disease in the future.

PROPOSED SYSTEM: 
This section depicts the overview of the proposed system and illustrates all of the components, techniques,
and tools used for developing the entire system. To develop an intelligent and user-friendly heart disease 
prediction system, an efficient software tool is needed to train huge datasets and compare multiple 
machine learning algorithms. After choosing the robust algorithm with the best accuracy and performance 
measures, it will be implemented in the development of the smartphone-based application for detecting 
and predicting heart disease risk levels. Hardware components like Arduino/Raspberry Pi, different 
biomedical sensors, display monitors, buzzers, etc. are needed to build the continuous patient monitoring 
system and give Suggestions based on the prediction.
